# picross-go

This is an ongoing reimplementation of [picross-erl](https://github.com/coolparadox/picross-erl) in [Go](https://go.dev/).

- Go channels support the communication between the actors
- Execution performance has been favoured rather than strict adherence to the actor model
- Yes, I enjoy nonograms puzzles :-)
